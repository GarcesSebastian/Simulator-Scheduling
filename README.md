# 🚀 Simulator Scheduling

Welcome to Simulator Scheduling - your go-to tool for visualizing and understanding process scheduling algorithms!

## 🌟 Features

- 🔄 Simulate FCFS (First-Come, First-Served) and SJF (Shortest Job First) algorithms
- 🔢 Customizable number of processes
- ⏩ Adjustable simulation speed
- ⏯️ Start, pause, and resume functionality
- 🔄 Reset option for quick restarts
- ✏️ Real-time data editing
- 📊 Live progress tracking
- 📁 Import data from JSON, CSV, or TXT files

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Run the project using `npm start`

## 🎮 How to Use

1. **Choose Your Algorithm**: Select between FCFS and SJF from the dropdown menu.
2. **Set Up Processes**: Enter the number of processes and click 'Generate Processes'.
3. **Adjust Speed**: Set the simulation velocity (1-10) for your preferred pace.
4. **Start Simulating**: Hit 'Start' to begin. Use 'Pause' to halt and 'Resume' to continue.
5. **Monitor Progress**: Watch the simulation unfold in real-time through the progress log.
6. **Modify on the Fly**: Double-click any cell in the process table to edit values mid-simulation.
7. **Import Data**: Bring in your own datasets using JSON, CSV, or TXT files for custom scenarios.

## 💡 Why Use Simulator Scheduling?
